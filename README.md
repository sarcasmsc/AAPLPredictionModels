# AAPLPredictionModels

Models created to try and predict whether the next's price will go up or down.
The AAPL page is just code that I used to edit the data sets, though not organized and just shows my code as i was working with the data sets
Included are the completed data set and a slideshow along with an excel sheet of all results
